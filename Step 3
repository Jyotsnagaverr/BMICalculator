Now we will write the function to Calculator BMI and add the event with button click event. So whenever we will click on the button it will calculate the BMI.

Let me show you the formula first then we will add this to our file demo.dart based on our case.
/*
    @params heigh is in Meter
    @params weight is in Kilogram
*/
double calculateBMI(double height, double weight){
    double heightSquare = height * height;
    double result = weight / heightSquare;
    return result;
}
The above code is for refernce so that you can know the formula for BMI(in case you don't know) .
void calculateBMI(){
    double height = double.parse(_heightController.text) / 100;
    double weight = double.parse(_weightController.text);
    // We dived height by 100 because we are taking the height in centimeter
    // and formula takes height in meter.

    double heightSquare = height * height;
    double result = weight / heightSquare;
    print(result);
}.
Letâ€™s attach the method to the button click or press.
RaisedButton(
    color: Colors.pinkAccent,
    child: Text(
        "Calculate",
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
    ),
    onPressed: calculateBMI,
),
