In this step we will limit the two digit after the decimal so that it will look consistent and not break the UI.

The above code is good and everything works fine but there is a UI related issue which user will face someday.
There is one more issue that the decimal value could be very long i.e. There could be 2 digit after decimal or 8 digit after decimal.
Letâ€™s make the UI consistent by doing a simple tweaks.
Text(
  _result == null ? "Enter Value" : "BMI : ${_result.toStringAsFixed(2)}",
  style: TextStyle(
    color: Colors.redAccent,
    fontSize: 19.4,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
  ),
),
toStringAsFixed allow us to limit the number of number after decimal.
